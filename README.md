# Sales-Analysis-for-Customer-to-Order-KPIs-and-Business-Growth
## Introduction:
The Sales Analysis for Customer-to-Order Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a comprehensive project aimed at enhancing business growth and profitability by identifying valuable insights from sales data. The primary focus is on understanding customer behavior, optimizing order processes, and increasing overall business efficiency. Through advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of an intuitive dashboard for stakeholders, the project aims to provide actionable recommendations to drive the company's success.

## Objectives:
#### The main objectives of this project are as follows:

###### Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Define and analyze essential KPIs related to sales, customer engagement, and order processing to measure the company's performance accurately.

##### Customer Behavior Analysis: 
Explore customer data to understand their preferences, purchasing patterns, and buying frequency. This analysis will provide valuable insights into customer segmentation and help tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

##### Order Process Optimization:
Evaluate the end-to-end order fulfilment process, from when an order is placed to its delivery. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the process to streamline operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

##### Business Growth Opportunities: 
Discover potential growth opportunities by analyzing sales trends, identifying high-performing products, and exploring untapped markets. These insights will inform strategic decision-making to expand the business.

## Methodology:
The project utilizes a data-driven approach with advanced exploratory data analysis techniques and data visualization to gain valuable insights. Statistical methods and machine learning algorithms may be applied to identify patterns and correlations within the data.

######  IMPORT LIBRARIES
 import pandas as pd
 
 import numpy as np
 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It 
allows you to read and write data from various file formats, explore and clean 
data, perform data preprocessing tasks, visualize data using other libraries, and 
conduct statistical analysis.

Matplotlib is a widely used data visualization library in Python. It provides a 
flexible and comprehensive set of functions for creating various types of plots, 
including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more. With 
Matplotlib, you can customize every aspect of your plots to create visually 
appealing and informative visualizations.

### Data Profiling:-
First of all, we have done data profiling. It has the following advantages-

Data profiling is the process of examining and analyzing a dataset to understand its structure, quality, and content.

The primary goal of data profiling is to gain insights into the characteristics of the data, which can be useful for various data management and analysis tasks.

Data profiling helps also help to identify â€“
       Data Structure, Data Quality, Data pattern etc.

###### Import Data 

df=pd.read_excel(r"C:\Users\pooja\OneDrive\Documents\Data_E112.xlsx")

###### Cleaning the data

1. This Data addresses the challenge of removing '#' 
values from data sets. The presence of '#' values 
poses a problem for data analysis as it hinders 
accurate calculations and insights.
So, replace the '#' value to 0  

df.replace('#',0,inplace=True)

2. convert "str" value into "INR"    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93ad872a-f61d-4509-975b-e265205b3ea8)

   
def clean_curreny(x):  

    if isinstance(x, str):
        return(x.replace('INR','USD' '').replace(',',' ')
    return(x)
   
3. Find all the null values in a data set
   
   df.isnull().sum()

4. Change the data type as per the required column

## Dashboard Creation:

A user-friendly and interactive dashboard is developed to present the findings in a visually appealing manner. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to explore the KPIs, customer behaviour trends, and order processing metrics in real time. This will provide stakeholders with a holistic view of the business's performance and help them make data-driven decisions.

## Expected Deliverables:

Comprehensive Analysis Report: A detailed report outlining the methodology, findings, and insights gained from the analysis. The report will include actionable recommendations to enhance business performance based on the identified KPIs.

## Conclusion:

The Sales Analysis for Customer-to-Order KPIs and Business Growth project aims to provide valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and order processing efficiency. Through the creation of an interactive dashboard and a comprehensive analysis report, stakeholders will be equipped with the knowledge to make informed decisions and implement strategies to drive business growth and success. By leveraging data-driven insights, the company can stay ahead of the competition and adapt to evolving market trends effectively.
